# CSC412 Course Project Part 2: Seminal Input Features Detection
## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a static analysis tool based on LLVM that can automatically figure out the part of the inputs to a C program that determine the behaviors of a program at its key points. To achieve this, we have leveraged LibClang, a sub-tool from the Clang C-Family frontend under the larger LLVM Compiler Infrastructure Project.
